# Excel and Tableau Visualization Project: Wealth of Nations üåç

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the Wealth of Nations dataset using both Excel and Tableau. The main goal is to explore the relationship between economic metrics and technology usage, alongside health indicators across various countries.

## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, filtering, sorting, and chart creation.
- **Tableau**: Data visualization through interactive dashboards.

## Data Processing in Excel üìä
The dataset was first processed in Excel where the following tasks were performed:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed inconsistencies and filled missing values.
- **Data Filtering**: Filtered data to focus on relevant countries and years.
- **Data Sorting**: Sorted data to prioritize key metrics.
- **Chart Creation**: Developed charts to initially explore data trends.
- **File Protection**: Implemented protection to secure the data and formulas in Excel files.

## Visualization in Tableau üìà
After processing the data in Excel, it was imported into Tableau for advanced visualization:
- **Dashboard Creation**: A comprehensive dashboard consisting of four main visualizations was developed to provide insights into:
  1. **GDP vs. Smartphone Users**: Analyzes the correlation between a nation's GDP and its number of smartphone users.
  2. **Life Expectancy at Birth**: Visualizes how life expectancy correlates with other economic and technological factors.
  3. **Number of Smartphone Users**: Displays trends and distributions of smartphone users across different nations.

## How to Use This Repository üìù
- **Data Folder**: Contains the initial and processed datasets in Excel format.
- **Scripts Folder**: Includes any scripts used for data processing and cleaning.
- **Tableau Dashboards Folder**: Contains the Tableau workbook files used for creating the visualizations.

## Installation and Setup üîß
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.
2. **Excel Files**: Open the Excel files using Microsoft Excel. Ensure macros are enabled if necessary.
3. **Tableau Files**: Open the `.twb` or `.twbx` files in Tableau Desktop to explore the interactive dashboards.
